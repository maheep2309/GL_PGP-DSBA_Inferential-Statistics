# GL_PGP-DSBA_Inferential-Statistics
This project applies probability, quality checks, and hypothesis testing to sports injuries, gunny bag strength, stone hardness, and dental implants. Using statistical tests and ANOVA, it identifies key differences and supports data-driven operational decisions.

# Project Summary
This project brings together four diverse real-world analytical scenarios and applies a wide range of statistical techniques to derive meaningful business and operational insights.

It begins with probability analysis on football injury data, identifying likelihoods of injury by player roles and exploring conditional probabilities, helping understand risk patterns in sports teams.

Next, the project evaluates gunny bag strength using properties of the normal distribution to compute proportions of defective or substandard bags. This supports material quality assessment and helps manufacturers reduce wastage and improve supply-chain efficiency.

The third component investigates stone hardness for the Zingaro printing process. Through exploratory data analysis, threshold checks, and hypothesis testing (one-sample and two-sample t-tests), it evaluates whether unpolished stones meet printing standards and whether polished and unpolished stones differ significantly. These findings guide quality control and process refinement.

The fourth and most advanced section analyzes dental implant hardness, influenced by multiple factors—dentists, methods, temperature, and alloy type. Using univariate analysis, variance tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD, the project evaluates individual and interaction effects. It identifies which methods are reliable, where inconsistencies arise, and how dentist-method combinations impact results, supporting performance standardization and training.

Overall, the project demonstrates comprehensive statistical reasoning—from descriptive insights to inferential testing—and delivers actionable conclusions for quality improvement, operational decision-making, and process optimization across industries.
